As a project based primarily on open-source software, it is possible that such sanctioned persons may nevertheless bypass prohibitions, obtain the code comprising the Solana blockchain protocol (or other project code or applications) and deploy, integrate, or otherwise use it. Accordingly, there is a risk to individuals that other persons using the Solana blockchain protocol may be sanctioned persons and that transactions with such persons would be a violation of U.S. export controls and sanctions law. This risk applies to individuals, organizations, and other ecosystem participants that deploy, integrate, or use the Solana blockchain protocol code directly (e.g., as a node operator), and individuals that transact on the Solana blockchain through light clients, third party interfaces, and/or wallet software.","paragraph-4":"Participation Terms."}},"team-up":{"authenticate":"Sign up to team up","header":{"user-menu":{"my-team-ups":"My Team-Ups","logout":"Logout"}},"count-label":"\u003cemphasis\u003e{requestCount}\u003c/emphasis\u003e Team-Up requests","search":{"aria-label":"Search through participants","placeholder":"Search participants by name, skills, profession, or in their description...","total-participants":"Displaying {currentCountStart} to {currentCountEnd} of {totalCount} participants","previous-page":"Previous","next-page":"Next","query-result":"Displaying {currentCountStart} to {currentCountEnd} of {resultCount} participants matching your query","sort-by":"Sort by","sort-types":{"none":"Default","newest":"Newest","oldest":"Oldest","teamups-asc":"Requests (ASC)","teamups-desc":"Requests (DESC)","name-asc":"Name (ASC)","name-desc":"Name (DESC)","slug-asc":"Slug (ASC)","slug-desc":"Slug (DESC)"}},"request":{"default":"Request team-up","default-active":"Cancel team-up request","pending":"Request pending","accepted":"Request accepted","denied":"Request denied"},"user-requests":{"title":"Team-up profile","inbound":"({count}) Team-up requests you received","outbound":"({count}) Team-ups you requested","none":"You have no Team-up requests up till now.","accept":"Accept request","deny":"Deny request"},"request-form":{"submit-btn":"Submit request","request-message-field":"Request Message","request-message-placeholder":"Write about why you want to team up","error":"An error occurred while submitting your request, please try again later."},"reply-form":{"submit-btn":"Submit reply","reply-message-field":"Reply Message (optional)","reply-message-placeholder":"Optionally add a message to your reaction","error":"An error occurred while submitting your reaction, please try again later."},"signup":{"back-btn":"Go back","main-step":{"title":"Sign up to team up!","description":"Hi {name}, nice to have you!
